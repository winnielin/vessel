# Vessel Geo Monitoring

## Coding To Do

### Fleet Page  

1. show weather info - implement a tile layer to the map (weather radar map) -> how to change location 
2. fake dropdown list - CustomOverlay Class (ref:https://www.shipmap.org)  
3. planned vessel event button function - (approval & reject, additional premium)  
4. actual vessel event - clear map  
5. remove specific polygons -> layer?  
6. a block with political and piracy events  
7. how to use zone entry & exit data?  

### d3.js chart block

1. zone chart strange???  
2. year 2018,19 change to slider  
3. solve the size of svg (always minimize sidebar)  
  
~~1. select vessels from the table then add data into chart~~  
~~2. age slider, vessel type & shipping company selector~~  
~~3. valuation chart - stacked bar & line~~  
~~4. mileage + port visits + ??~~  
~~5. restricted zone visits - by zone -> total accepted, change more/less~~  
~~6. some claims, premium, value information message by side~~  

### Vessel Page

1. remove heatmap
1. zone visits graph put somewhere for kimi  
2. past important events block  
3. using queue.js to show all JWC zones  
4. dropdown list for all vessels  

#### Bing Maps  

1. how to untick route then remove only specific polyline from the map (different layer)    
2. direction for vessel  
  
~~1. check how many zones a vessel crossed by checking points from the route~~  
~~2. how many times planned schedule to cross the zone -> show zone + alert (zone call)~~  
~~3. current location generate alert (if huge deviation -> reason)~~  

#### Template  

~~1. receive vessel name then read csv file and show the basic information of the selected vessel~~  
~~2. notification block read from csv file~~  
~~3. date selector (a date or a period)~~
