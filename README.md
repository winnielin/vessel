# Vessel Geo Monitoring

## Coding To Do

### Fleet Page  

1. fleet interaction table which can be selected then show vessel & passage plan on the map -> increase to 15/16 vessels  
2. heat map layer - show weather info ???  
3. combine chart into index.html -> just create chart.html and use the same outline  
4. add notification block with table and button by the side of the map
5. on the map ->show one vessel in vincity with a circle that labeled the value of these vessels (maybe 3)  
6. a block with political and piracy events  
7. how to use zone entry & exit data  

### d3.js chart page

1. select vessels from the table then add data into chart  
2. age slider, vessel type & shipphing company selector  
3. valuation chart - stacked bar & line  
4. mileage + port visits + 
5. restricted zone visits - by zone -> total accepted, change more/less  
6. some claims, premium, value information message by side  

### Vessel Page

1. vessels in vincity - alert & csv download btn  
2. deviation notification popup on the map  
3. made red sth (heatmap) at deviation - extreme weather  
4. zone overlayed - show all JWC
5. infobox - title: vessel value: 200M, subtitle: cargo value: 1B  
6. vincity - circle & 1B label, notification: 15 vessels, value 1B, near warzone Iran  
7. zone visits graph put somewhere for a vessel  

#### Bing Maps  

1. show more zones data -> don't just copy paste  
2. how to untick route then remove only specific polyline from the map (different layer)    
~~3. check how many zones a vessel crossed by checking points from the route~~  
~~4. how many times planned schedule to cross the zone -> show zone + alert (zone call)~~  
~~5. current location generate alert (if huge deviation -> reason)~~  
6. direction for vessel  

#### Template

1. add scrollbar on table
~~1. receive vessel name then read csv file and show the basic information of the selected vessel~~  
~~2. notification block read from csv file~~  
~~3. date selector (a date or a period)~~
