# Vessel Geo Monitoring

## Coding To Do

### Bing Maps

1. ask for more zones data (e.g. HRA)
2. direction for vessel
3. mouse event for different layers (ship speed, temperature, latitude, longitude)
4. check how many zones a vessel crossed by checking points from the route
5. how many times planned schedule to cross the zone -> show zone + alert (zone call)
6. current location generate alert (if huge deviation -> reason)  
7. generate planned schedule from actual one  
   -random noise (v)  
   -change on destination  


### Template

ALL NEED READING CSV FILE!!!  
1. read csv file and show the basic information of the selected vessel  
2. notification block read from csv file  
3. a block for important past details or events relating to the vessel (flag changes, ownership changes, valuation changes)   
4. a block for recent news from nearby ports and other marine activities relevant  
5. date selector (a date or a period)

### Other Visualisations

1. d3.js  
2. c3.js  
3.

## Problems
1. untick route to remove from the map
2.
3.

## Questions
1. how to combine scenario with map/webpage? e.g. smuggling/ environment hazard
2.
