# Vessel Geo Monitoring

## Coding To Do

### Fleet Page  

1. fleet interaction table which can be selected then show vessel & passage plan on the map -> increase to 15/16 vessels  
2. heat map layer - show weather info  
3. combine chart into index.html  
4. add notification block with table and button by the side of the map
5. on the map ->show one vessel in vincity with a circle that labeled the value of these vessels (maybe 3)  

#### d3.js chart

1.  
2.  
3.  

#### Bing Maps  

1. show more zones data (HRA & EAST_SAUDI_ARABIA_TTW, YEMEN, SAUDI_ARABIA, ERITREA_HRA) -> don't copy paste  
2. how to untick route then remove only specific polyline from the map (different layer)    
3. check how many zones a vessel crossed by checking points from the route  
4. how many times planned schedule to cross the zone -> show zone + alert (zone call)  
5. current location generate alert (if huge deviation -> reason)  
6. direction for vessel  

#### Template

1. receive vessel name then read csv file and show the basic information of the selected vessel  
2. notification block read from csv file  
3. date selector (a date or a period)  

### Vessel Page

1. vessels in vincity - alert & csv download btn  
2. value change types?  
3. the block of important details should put on the top of the page
