# Vessel Geo Monitoring

## Coding To Do

### Vessel Page

1. made red sth (heatmap) at deviation - extreme weather  
2. zone overlayed - show all JWC -> queue.js
3. zone visits graph put somewhere for kimi  

### Fleet Page  

1. planned or actual vessel event  
2. remove specific polygons -> layer???
2. notification - approval button function  
3. show weather info - heat map layer ???  
4. on the map ->show one vessel in vincity with a circle that labeled the value of these vessels (maybe 3)  
5. a block with political and piracy events  
6. how to use zone entry & exit data  

### d3.js chart page

1. select vessels from the table then add data into chart  
2. age slider, vessel type & shipping company selector  
3. valuation chart - stacked bar & line  
4. mileage + port visits +  
5. restricted zone visits - by zone -> total accepted, change more/less  
6. some claims, premium, value information message by side  

#### Bing Maps  

1. how to untick route then remove only specific polyline from the map (different layer)    
~~2. check how many zones a vessel crossed by checking points from the route~~  
~~3. how many times planned schedule to cross the zone -> show zone + alert (zone call)~~  
~~4. current location generate alert (if huge deviation -> reason)~~  
5. direction for vessel  

#### Template

~~1. receive vessel name then read csv file and show the basic information of the selected vessel~~  
~~2. notification block read from csv file~~  
~~3. date selector (a date or a period)~~
